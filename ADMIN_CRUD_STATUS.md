## 🔧 Issues to Fix:

### 1. Route Inconsistencies
- Admin Products links to `/admin/products/create` but route is `products/create` under admin layout
- Admin Products links to `/admin/products/edit/:id` but route is `products/edit/:id`

### 2. Missing Features
- Admin Users doesn't have a create user function (may not be needed)
- Some delete confirmations use browser confirm() instead of modal

### 3. API Endpoint Verification Needed
- Check if all backend endpoints exist and work
- Verify authentication and admin middleware on all endpoints

## Next Steps:
1. Fix route paths in AdminProducts component
2. Test all delete operations
3. Verify all backend endpoints
4. Add proper error handling where missing
5. Ensure consistent UI/UX across all CRUD operations
