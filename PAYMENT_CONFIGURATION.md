# Payment Gateway Configuration - Production Mode

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Production Payment Configuration

This document outlines the payment gateway configuration for Quicksell. The system is now configured for **PRODUCTION/LIVE** payments.

## Current Configuration Status

### 1. PayFast (South African Payment Gateway)
- **Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION MODE
- **Merchant ID**: 24863159
- **Test Mode**: DISABLED
- **Sandbox**: DISABLED
- **Live URL**: https://www.payfast.co.za/eng/process

### 2. Flutterwave (International Payment Gateway)
- **Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION MODE
- **Test Mode**: DISABLED
- **Current Keys**: LIVE keys configured
- **Live URL**: https://api.flutterwave.com

## Production Mode Status

### Both Payment Gateways are now LIVE! ✅

#### Flutterwave:
- ✅ Live API keys configured
- ✅ Production mode enabled
- ✅ Ready to accept international payments

#### PayFast:
- ✅ Already configured with production credentials
- Ensure your PayFast merchant account is approved and active
- Verify your business details are complete in PayFast dashboard

## Testing Production Payments

### Before Going Live:
1. **Verify merchant accounts** are approved and active
2. **Test with small amounts** first (R1-R10)
3. **Monitor first transactions** carefully
4. **Check webhook endpoints** are working
5. **Verify SSL certificates** are valid

### Payment Flow:
1. Customer selects payment method (PayFast/Flutterwave)
2. System generates payment request with production URLs
3. Customer is redirected to payment gateway
4. Payment is processed through live gateway
5. Customer returns to success/cancel page
6. Webhook confirms payment status

## Security Considerations

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
3. **Implement rate limiting** on payment endpoints
4. **Log all payment attempts** for audit trail
5. **Use HTTPS only** for production
