# Fix for "Failed to download remote update" Error

## Quick Fix
The error occurs because Expo Go is trying to download updates from Expo's servers. Here are multiple solutions:

## Solution 1: Use Web Browser (Immediate Testing)
1. Open Chrome/Edge: **http://localhost:19003**
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Click the device toggle to simulate mobile view
4. Test the app functionality

## Solution 2: Build Local APK (Permanent Solution)
Run these commands to create a standalone APK:

```bash
cd E:\Quicksell\mobile

# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Build APK locally (no Expo account needed)
npx expo prebuild --platform android
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

# APK will be in: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/
```

## Solution 3: Use Android Emulator
1. Install Android Studio
2. Create an AVD (Android Virtual Device)
3. Run: `npx expo start --android`

## Solution 4: Modified Expo Go Connection
Try these URLs in Expo Go:
- `exp://192.168.100.24:19003/--/`
- `exp+quicksell://expo-development-client/?url=http://192.168.100.24:19003`

## Why This Happens
- Expo Go expects to download JavaScript bundles from Expo's CDN
- Your firewall or network might be blocking these requests
- The app is configured for local development only

## Recommended: Web Testing First
Since all features work in the browser, test there first while we prepare the standalone APK.
